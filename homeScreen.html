      Hydroponics
   </h2>
   <div class="hydroponics">Hydroponics is a method of farming that utilizes nutrient-infused water to grow plants rather than soil. In hydroponics, the plant roots are submerged in a nutrient solution. This solution can be customized to cater towards the crop’s specific needs during each stage of the plant’s growing cycle. The driving idea is that when you remove the barrier (the soil) between the nutrients and the roots, the plant will grow faster and be of a better quality. This has been proven and plants grown through hydroponics grow 15-20% faster than conventional plant farming. A downside of hydroponics is that it is more difficult to grow crops with deep roots like carrots and potatoes, but this can be overcome utilizing different methods. Hydroponics is also much more water efficient than conventional farming despite the main supply of nutrients being through a water-based solution. Hydroponics collects and reuses the water, saving 70-90% more water than traditional soil farming. </div>
